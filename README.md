## Overview

**The Agent Asset Registry is the first community-driven catalog of known AI agent types.** As autonomous AI agents proliferate across every industry — from customer support and code generation to financial trading and legal document processing — there is no central, standardized repository for tracking who builds them, what they do, and how they behave.

This registry fills that gap.

We collect, categorize, and document AI agent types in a structured, machine-readable format. Each entry describes an agent's capabilities, risk profile, known behavioral patterns, and detection signatures. The result is a shared knowledge base that enables security researchers, governance platforms, compliance officers, and developers to understand the agent landscape.

### Why This Matters

AI agents are no longer experimental. They are deployed in production systems processing financial transactions, drafting legal contracts, managing email workflows, and writing production code. Yet there is no equivalent of a CVE database or software bill of materials for AI agents. When a new agent type appears, there is no standard way to answer:

- **What is this agent capable of?**
- **What risk level does it carry?**
- **Has it been observed exhibiting unexpected behaviors?**
- **What signatures can detect it in a runtime environment?**

The Agent Asset Registry exists to answer these questions — and to provide a foundation for governance tools like [WitnessOS](https://witnessos.nousresearch.com), a governance runtime for AI agents, to build upon.

### Who Is This For?

- **Security researchers** cataloging agent behaviors and attack surfaces
- **Platform operators** deploying governance controls around agents
- **Compliance teams** assessing third-party agent integrations
- **Developers** building agents who want to understand the ecosystem
- **Policy makers** studying the landscape of autonomous systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`)

### Validate the Registry

```bash
python tools/validate-registry.py
```

This checks all agent type and vendor YAML files against the JSON schema and reports any structural issues.

### Search Agents

```bash
# Search by keyword
python tools/search-registry.py --keyword "trading"

# Filter by category
python tools/search-registry.py --category "general-purpose"

# Filter by risk level
python tools/search-registry.py --risk-level "high"

# Combine filters
python tools/search-registry.py --category "workflow" --risk-level "medium"
```

### Generate a Report

```bash
python tools/generate-report.py
```

Produces a formatted summary of all registered agents, organized by category, with risk distributions and capability overviews.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. To add a new agent type:

1. **Fork** this repository
2. Create a **YAML file** in the appropriate category under `registry/agent_types/`
3. Follow the **schema** defined in `schema/agent-type-schema.json`
4. Run **validation** with `tools/validate-registry.py`
5. Submit a **pull request**

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines.

## The Agent Governance Problem

The proliferation of AI agents creates a fundamental accountability gap. Unlike traditional software components, agents can:

- **Act autonomously** within their delegated authority
- **Execute multi-step plans** across systems
- **Interact with other agents** in ways that are hard to audit
- **Evolve behaviors** through learning and prompt injection
- **Operate opaquely** behind API boundaries

The Agent Asset Registry is one piece of the solution — providing transparency into what agents exist and what they do. Combined with governance runtimes like [WitnessOS](https://witnessos.nousresearch.com), organizations can move from blind trust to verifiable control over their agent ecosystems.
